# liri-node-app
## Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

The LIRI node app should toggle through one of 4 user input commands: 
*concert-this
*spotify-this-song
*movie-this
*do-what-it-says

**concert-this** will eventually(working on this still) be able to search Bands in Town Artist Events API for an artist and will render the following about each event to the terminal:

* Name of the venue

* Venue location

* Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")
